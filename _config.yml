          During my time at ESAIP, I had the privilege of being immersed in the dynamic environment of the School of Responsible Futures. As the president of the 'Intelligentsia' club, which focused on economic intelligence, history, Sciences Po finance, and geopolitics, I actively organized conferences and disseminated newsletters. Additionally, I engaged in a compelling project on Symbolic AI, with guidance and support from an entrepreneurial representative. 
          
          ESAIP's strategic locations in cities like Angers, Aix-en-Provence, and Reims provided an enriching backdrop for both academic pursuits and professional collaborations.
